/*
  
   lets start by building our header components. With it we have a few features tthat will make it unique. 

   first when the page is not at the top of the windown, the background will be transparent. 

   when we are at the top of the page the background will be white. 

   based on the tailwindcss configuration, when the window view is small or medium, there will be a mobile menu that when click, the menu icon transitions to a x

   the menu will ttransition from the left with a spring animation using framer motion

   You will notice 3 sections on it, a header which has the logo, the body, which has the links, and a simple footer

   finally u will notice that as we hover over each link there is a underline effect that transitons under the link name. 

   this is accomplished by using tailwindcss class utlity which gives more flexibility to right css but also creates a mini component thats reusable
